# Advent of Code 2024 ☃️

An Advent of Code[^aoc] implementation in Kotlin using the [template][template] provided by JetBrains

This is being used as a learning bed for [Kotlin][docs].

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.

## Day Template
A new day can be created from the template by running
```shell
./gradlew -Pday=XX -Ptitle=YY createDay
```
where `day` is the number, and `title` is the name associated with the day
